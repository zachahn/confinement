I believe we can provide jobs to the jobless, homes to the homeless, and reclaim
young people in cities across America from violence and despair. Not just with
words, but with deeds - by investing in our schools and our communities; by
enforcing our civil rights laws and ensuring fairness in our criminal justice
system; by providing this generation with ladders of opportunity that were
unavailable for previous generations.

You make a big election about small things. America, this is one of those
moments.

But by the time he was a young adult, he was an atheist. I submitted myself to
His will, and dedicated myself to discovering His truth and carrying out His
works. They are full of dancing, clapping, screaming and shouting that may seem
jarring to the untrained ear. They have killed people of different faiths - more
than any other, they have killed Muslims.

John Kerry understands the ideals of community, faith, and service because
they've defined his life. There is not a Black America and a White America and
Latino America and Asian America - there's the United States of America. That's
the promise we need to keep. Too much blood has been shed.

And he knows that it's not enough for just some of us to prosper. And I found
that I recognized in these folks a part of myself. Just as black anger often
proved counterproductive, so have these white resentments distracted attention
from the real culprits of the middle class squeeze - a corporate culture rife
with inside dealing, questionable accounting practices, and short-term greed; a
Washington dominated by lobbyists and special interests; economic policies that
favor the few over the many. The Arab-Israeli conflict should no longer be used
to distract the people of Arab nations from other problems. But privately, many
Muslims recognize that Israel will not go away. Trade can bring new wealth and
opportunities, but also huge disruptions and changing communities.

Thank you, God Bless you, and God Bless the United States of America.
